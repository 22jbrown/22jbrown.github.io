<h2><u>All about stan lee</u></h2>
<br>
<p>In 1939, a teenage Stan Lee began his career in comics and 75 years later, he is celebrated as the creative tour de force behind Marvel’s Silver Age - the co-creator of beloved characters like Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Hulk, Thor and the X-Men".<p>
<br>
<p>Stan Lee, original name Stanley Martin Lieber, (born December 28, 1922, New York, New York, U.S.—died November 12, 2018, Los Angeles, California), American comic book writer best known for his work with Marvel Comics. Among the hundreds of characters and teams that he helped to create were the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the X-Men.<p>
<br>
<p>After graduating from high school at age 16, Lieber was hired as an editorial assistant for Timely Comics, and in 1942 he was promoted to editor. By that time he had begun writing comic-book scripts for Timely as Stan Lee, a pseudonym that eventually became his legal name. In the 1940s and ’50s—during which time the group, later named Atlas, struggled financially—Lee created several comic-book series, including The Witness, The Destroyer, Jack Frost, Whizzer, and Black Marvel<p>.
